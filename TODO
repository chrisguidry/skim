Cleaning
--------

* <code> and <a> tags; they don't render properly in either order of nesting (eg http://benno.id.au/blog/feed/)
* vice.com's entry tags are an embedded comma-separated list of tags

Feature ideas
-------------

* Some sort of pagination/infinite scroll
* Prerendering articles (Markdown is the overwhelming amount of time in rendering a page)
* search result highlighting
* Full-text feeds for HN, Slashdot, etc
* Full-image feeds for APOD, etc
* Image caching, image size inlining, and smarter styling based on size
** Stripping 1x1 trackers
* Inline YouTube, Vimeo, etc. videos
** partially done for vice.com, and PyEmbed is integrated
