# Core App

## Have GOT to get a handle on "database is locked" errors

## Feed frequency stats on the frontend

## Full-text search

## Sending articles directly to Wallabag?

## Handle custom error pages

## Uniformly localized dates/times on the frontend

## Normalize and store enclosures on entries

## Crawling support for feed-level crawling hints (TTL, etc)

## Fetching favicons for sites that don't include them in the feeds

## Fetching full articles?

In the spirit of microservices, this should probably be its own thing.

## Caching images?

## A quick way to jump to the next article?

First, does this violate the spirit of skim?  If not, then it would be nice
to pop ahead to the next article instead of scrolling a potentially long one.
